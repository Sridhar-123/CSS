        1. What is degree of Polymerization and explain the term functionality <br>
    Ans: It is no of times the repeatition of the monomers to form a polymer is called Polymerization.
    The number of active bonding sites in a monomer is called its Functionality.

 2.List any four advantages of plastics.
 <ol>
    <li>Thermal and Electrical Insulation</li>
    <li>Lithgness in weight ,portable </li>
    <li>Sctrach and Growth Resistance</li>
    <li>Good resistance toward Sunlight</li>
 </ol>
 3. Define a conducting Polymer? Give the classification of conducting Polymers.
A Polymer which conducts electricity is called conduction polymers.It is due to his unsaturated double bonds or losing of electrons in the process of doping.
